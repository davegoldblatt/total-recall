Thanks for trying Total Recall. I'm optimizing for: "stays useful after a week," not "captures everything."

## Setup
- Install mode: plugin or standalone
- OS:
- Claude Code version:
- Repo type: personal or work

## What you tried
- Commands you ran (copy/paste):
- What you expected:
- What actually happened:

## Signal
- First "holy shit it remembered" moment (if any):
- First "this is annoying / I might uninstall" moment:

## Write gate + nudges
- Write gate felt: too strict, too loose, about right
- Recall nudges: helpful, annoying, didn't notice them
- If annoying: what would make them tolerable?

## Privacy / safety
- Anything you'd never want committed to git?
- Anything that feels creepy or surprising?

## If you have a fix idea
Problem:
Example:
Proposed change:
